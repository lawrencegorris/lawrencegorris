### 'Hello there.' -Obi-Wan Kenobi (Revenge of the Sith, Kenobi, A New Hope)

And welcome dear reader to my GitHub profile.
My name is Lawrence Gorris from Antwerp, Belgium and I'm currently a student (but aren't we all in this thing called "life"?).
Soon I will start my .NET C# course to increase my skillset and improve my overall programming knowledge.

On my GitHub profile you will find some projects. Some finished, some halfway finished and some that... are also here.
But besides that there's also some more info about my education, my programming toolset and some things about myself.

Enjoy your stay!
And may the Force be with you, forever. -Harry Potter (Lord of the Rings, 1782)

### About Me
- You'll probably find me either out in during a sunset taking way too many pics of the sky, somewhere vibing to my spotify playlists or sitting behind blue light emmiting screens programming the day away.
- Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Node, Express, Vue, React, and some other libraries/frameworks. All varrying degrees of comfortness and skill. 

### Education
- (Currently awaiting to start my .NET C# course at VDAB Antwerpen.)
- Full Stack Web Development @ BeCode Antwerpen
- Webdesigner @ CVO Encora
- (unrelated) Gezondheid en Welzijnswetenschappen (lit. translation 'Health and Wellbeing Sciences); so if you want to talk about the anatomy of the heart, Skinner's experiments or how to best teach a child that vacuum cleaners are not there to pick them up of the ground, find someone else since I barely remember anything except that hearing the name Pavlov rings a bell inside my head.

### Contact info

### Some more stuff:
- I can't stand seafood

- I am scared of spiders, depths (as in the ocean), heights and the inevetable ending of my existence.
- I don't like anything about super heroes.
- I love Star Wars tho.
