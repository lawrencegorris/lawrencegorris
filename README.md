### 'Hello there.' -Obi-Wan Kenobi (Revenge of the Sith, Kenobi, A New Hope)

And welcome dear reader to my GitHub profile.
My name is Lawrence Gorris residing in Antwerp, Belgium and I'm currently a student (but aren't we all in this thing called "life"?).

On my GitHub profile you will find some projects. Some finished, some halfway finished and some that... are also here.
But besides that there's also some more info about my education, my programming toolset and some things about myself.

Enjoy your stay and may the Force be with you!

### About Me
- You'll probably find me either out in during a sunset taking way too many pictures of the sky, somewhere vibing to my music playlists or sitting behind blue light emmiting screens programming the day away.

### Education
- Currently a student at Karel de Grote Antwerpen studying Toegepaste Informatica (Applied Computer Science); 2nd year.
- Software Developer with .NET C# course at VDAB Antwerpen.
- Full Stack Web Development @ BeCode Antwerpen
- Webdesigner @ CVO Encora
- (unrelated) Gezondheid en Welzijnswetenschappen (lit. translation 'Health and Wellbeing Sciences); so if you want to talk about the anatomy of the heart, Skinner's experiments or how to best teach a child that vacuum cleaners are not there to pick them up of the ground, find someone else since I barely remember anything except that hearing the name Pavlov rings a bell.

### Contact info
- GitHub: You're here already! Good job. 10 points to your Hogwarts house!

### Some more stuff:
- Current fave artist: Ghost
- I can't stand seafood

- I don't like anything about super heroes.
- I love Star Wars tho.
